Dataset-- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VP9BE_eI2yl6uUHSm4mGiiwjRdoqCqnkcIjsv5Q2ex4/edit?usp=share_link

Preprocessing- The dataset consisted of two columns(College,Salary) having null values. The column College doesnot play any role in analysis as it is not in our field of consideration so the null values are replaced by a string("Unknown"). The column Salary is important and any filling of null values will lead to incorrect analysis so they are to be dropped however this drop will be delayed until analysis on other columns are carried out. The column(Height) is consisted of month-numerical value, numerical value-month combination. The month is converted to respective numerical value according to the order in the date format which brings us to a numerical value-numerical value format(eg."06-10"). For keeping with the integrity of the values, random values are assigned within some limits. 
    When left numerical value is 05 and right numerical value is less than or equal to 6, values are chosen randomly between 150 and 155.
    When left numerical value is 05 and right numerical value is more than 6, values are chosen randomly between 155 and 160.
    Likewise, when left numerical value is 6, random values between 160 and 170 are inserted and when left value is 7, random values between 170 and 180 is inserted.

Analysis Tasks-
1. Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.
2. Segregate employees based on their positions within the company.
3. Identify the predominant age group among employees.
4. Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure.
5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually.

Graphical Representation-
1. Columns Number, Age, Weight, Height, Salary(All the columns which consist of a numerical value) are plotted against each other using pairplot.

4. Barplots to find distribution of employees in each position within every team team. For efficient analysis, the map is split into 6 submaps containing 5 teams each.
